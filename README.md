# NPS Reservations in Rust

# Contributing

Fork [jsirois/rnps](https://github.com/jsirois/rnps), hack up a branch in your fork and send a pull
request.

You'll need a Rust distribution to compile and test your work. Consider using
[rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) if you don't already have a Rust toolchain installed. You can use
the CI script directly to compile and test against your Rust distribution by running:
`scripts/ci.sh`.

I use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to verify the build
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsirois/rnps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsirois/rnps).
This will attempt to compile and test your changes against the latest stable, beta and nightly Rust
distributions.
